## osmdata for Monash Medical Centre

A long-handed way to get the MMC polygon directly from Open Street Map
(because geocoding will only return a
    point)

``` r
library (osmdata)
```

    ## Data (c) OpenStreetMap contributors, ODbL 1.0. http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright

``` r
amen <- opq ("Clayton Victoria") %>%
    add_osm_feature (key = "amenity", value = "hospital") %>%
    osmdata_sf () %>%
    magrittr::extract2 ("osm_polygons")
mmc <- amen$geometry [grep ("Monash Medical Centre", amen$name)]
```

Most `dodgr` functions work with simple WGS-84-projected values, rather
than `sf` objects, so the MMC can be converted to a numeric centroid
here:

``` r
mmc <- as.numeric (sf::st_centroid (mmc [[1]]))
```

## Distance chloropleth

Extracting the surrounding street network can then be done very simply
with the [`dodgr` package](https://github.com/ATFutures/dodgr). The
`expand` argument is a relative expansion, so the value of `expand = 1`
will **double** the size of the bounding box. (And there is currently no
way to do this in absolute terms, although that would be a nifty
enhancement.)

``` r
library (dodgr)
dat <- dodgr_streetnet ("Clayton Victoria", expand = 1)
```

Weâ€™re only interested in routing automobiles here, so reduce the street
network to only appropriate types, to speed up calculations below. This
requires loading `sf` for the sub-setting to work properly.

``` r
table (dat$highway)
```

``` r
library (sf)
dat <- dat [which (!dat$highway %in%
                   c ("footway", "cycleway", "path", "pedestrian", "steps")), ]
```

Then extract distances between the MMC centroid and all points of the
surrounding network. The `dodgr_contract_graph()` function contracts the
street network to junction nodes only, which makes these kinds of
calculations much faster.

``` r
graph <- weight_streetnet (dat, wt_profile = "motorcar")
nrow (graph)
```

    ## [1] 81697

``` r
graph <- dodgr_contract_graph (graph)$graph
nrow (graph)
```

    ## [1] 37761

``` r
verts <- dodgr_vertices (graph)
d <- dodgr_dists (graph = graph, from = mmc, to = verts)
```

These distances then need to be mapped back on to the street network to
generate the chloropleth. They all come with OSM identifiers (here, the
`colnames`).

``` r
indx <- cbind (match (graph$from_id, colnames (d)),
               match (graph$to_id, colnames (d)))
# The "min" function below is arbitrary, but just takes one value
indx <- apply (indx, 1, function (i) min (i, na.rm = TRUE))
graph$dmmc <- d [indx]
```

## Visualistion

Visualising first requires conversion back to `sf` format:

``` r
graph_sfc <- dodgr_to_sfc (graph)
library (sf)
graph_sf <- st_sf (graph_sfc$dat, graph_sfc$geoms)
# not all nodes will necessarily be reachable on the network, so remove
# unreachable ones
graph_sf <- graph_sf [which (!is.na (graph_sf$dmmc)), ]
```

Then use `mapview` for a simple interactive visualisation (with
screenshot below).

``` r
library (mapview)
ncols <- 30
d <- graph_sf$dmmc / max (graph_sf$dmmc)
cols <- colorRampPalette (c ("lawngreen", "red")) (ncols) [ceiling (ncols * d)]
mapview (graph_sf, color = cols, lwd = 5 * (1 - d))
```
