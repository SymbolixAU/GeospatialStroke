# GeoSpatialStroke

## What is in this repo?

`scrape-gdrive-into-rmd.R`

This contains scripts that describe how I created "geospatial-stroke.Rmd"

`geospatial-stroke.Rmd`

* This is the `.Rmd` file which is used to create the tex file we will collaborate on. 
* I used the `.Rmd` file to create some of the citations thanks to the `knitcitations` package.
* The comments from the google drive doc are recorded here with letters a-l, recorded as  [a], with the corresponding format for [a] below it. Feel free to delete the [a]-[l] comments, but I just wanted to include them to start.

`references.bib`

The final references, partly generated inside the `.Rmd` file

`morgue.md`

This is a file that contains code/text that we want to remove from the paper, but don't want to part with right now  -there might be some good things in there.

`geospatial-stroke.tex`

* the `TeX` auto-generated by `geospatial.Rmd`.

`geospatial-stroke.pdf`

* the PDF generated by `geospatial.Rmd`

`auto-ref.bib`

* references automatically generated by `knitcitations` inside `geospatial-stroke.Rmd`

## So what do we edit?

My understanding is that are will edit the `geospatial-stroke.tex` file - the rest of the files here are mostly generated by the `.Rmd`. Feel free to move them somewhere else, perhaps a `raw` folder.

## NOTE

* Some of the references were generated by [zbib.org](https://zbib.org/) - sorry if they look weird! Feel free to edit.
