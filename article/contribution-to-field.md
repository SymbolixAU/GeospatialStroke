This paper provides a review of, and accessible introduction to, state
of the art geospatial software intended for clinical stroke
researchers and non-specialist citizen scientists. Geospatial analysis
tools have a long track record in the quantitative geography, city and
regional planning, and civil engineering research literatures and the
number of stroke research applications has been growing in recent
years. The techniques introduced in this paper can be used to adapt
modelling studies involving travel times and distances to local
geographies. This capability is important when optimizing stroke treatment
networks to provide fair access to resources and best possible care.

This paper introduces the fundamental topics of geospatial data,
visualisation, simulation, and modelling. It includes examples of
retrieving and combining geospatial data from multiple sources,
extracting addresses from latitude and longitude coordinates
(geocoding), estimating travel times and distances, and geospatial
data analysis. To facilitate reproducibility and impact, we provide
all source code.
