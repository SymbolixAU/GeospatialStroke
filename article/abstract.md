# A review of software tools, data and services for geospatial analysis of stroke services 

## Abstract

Time, transport and spatial position are common themes underlying many
questions relating to delivery of acute stroke treatment  - help must reach a patient, usually via road
transport and in some case air transport, the patient must be assessed
and transported to the ``best'' hospital, where the definition of
``best'' relates to both the transport duration and the services
(stroke therapy) available at the destination hospital. A framework
for modelling these scenarios is valuable in planning and evaluating
treatment services and exploring implications of new technological or
treatment choices and changes in population.

In the past, accessing these data and tools for analysis has been the domain of specialised commercial software and services. This is no longer the case. Geospatial data is now easily accessible, and can be used with and gathered by Free Open Source Software (FOSS) that implements state of the art techniques not available commercially. This opens up new possibilities to researchers and practitioners to generate actionable insights and impacts. We hope that this article will provide stroke researchers with a useful
introduction to the possibilities offered by these tools.

This review review article provides clinically relevant geospatial applications of R and Python to areas relevant for stroke researchers. It introduces the fundamental topics of geospatial data, visualisation, simulation, and modelling. This includes retrieving and combining geospatial data from multiple sources, extracting addresses from longitude and latitude coordinates (geocoding), estimating travel times and distances, and geospatial data analysis. To facilitate reproducibility and impact, we provide all source code.

**Results**

These examples illustrate fundamental geospatial computational components in R and python. This includes geocoding with databases and web services, interactive and static visualization. It also includes geometric computation of areas and distances, and geospatial computations of travel time.

**Conclusions**

The examples in this article illustrate the use of a range of components that underpin geospatial analysis. By providing an accessible introduction to these areas, clinicians and researchers can create code to answer clinically relevant questions on a topics such as service delivery and service demand. Importantly, these factor in key features of transport and travel time.
