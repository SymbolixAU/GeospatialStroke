# A review of software tools, data and services for geospatial analysis of stroke services 

## Abstract

To deliver the best acute treatment and rehabilitation we need geospatial information. This could be exact locations of patient incidence, ambulance location, and hospitals. It also includes information on hospital catchments, and distances and travel times between these locations. Combining this data with sophisticated modelling techniques can provide key insights into improving treatment and rehabilitation that can touch many lives.

In the past, accessing these data and tools for analysis has been the domain of specialised commercial software and services. This is no longer the case. Geospatial data is now easily accessible, and can be used with and gathered by Free Open Source Software (FOSS) that implements state of the art techniques not available commercially. This opens up new possibilities to researchers and practitioners to generate actionable insights and impacts. However, these tools and data could be better utilised.

This review review article aims to provide clinically relevant applications of FOSS languages R and Python to areas relevant for stroke researchers. It introduces the fundamental topics of geospatial data, visualisation, simulation, and modelling. This includes retrieving and combining geospatial data from multiple sources, extracting addresses from latitude and longitude coordinates (geocoding), estimating travel times and distances, and geospatial data analysis. To facilitate reproducibility and impact, we provide all source code.

**Results**

These examples illustrate fundamental geospatial computational components in R and python. This includes geocoding with databases and web services, interactive and static visualization. It also includes geometric computation of areas and distances, and geospatial computations of travel time.

**Conclusions**

The examples in this article illustrate the use of a range of components that underpin geospatial analysis. By providing an accessible introduction to these areas, clinicians and researchers can create code to answer clinically relevant questions on a topics such as service delivery and service demand. Importantly, these factor in key features of transport and travel time.
