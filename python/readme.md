# Geospatial analysis with Python

## Setup

To reproduce the analytical environment, the easiest method is with conda + conda-forge.

1. Install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

1. Create the virtual environment by running this command in your terminal (Mac/Linux) or command prompt (Windows): `conda create -n GEO -c conda-forge python=3 --file requirements.txt`

1. Activate the virtual environment with the command: `conda activate GEO`

1. To run the notebooks, change directories in your terminal/command prompt to the location of the notebook files, then run the command: `jupyter lab`
