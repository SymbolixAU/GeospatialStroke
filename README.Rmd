## osmdata for Monash Medical Centre

A long-handed way to get the MMC polygon directly from Open Street Map (because
geocoding will only return a point)

```{r osmdata}
library (osmdata)
amen <- opq ("Clayton Victoria") %>%
	add_osm_feature (key = "amenity", value = "hospital") %>%
	osmdata_sf () %>%
	magrittr::extract2 ("osm_polygons")
mmc <- amen$geometry [grep ("Monash Medical Centre", amen$name)]
```
Most `dodgr` functions work with simple WGS-84-projected values, rather than
`sf` objects, so the MMC can be converted to a numeric centroid here:
```{r mmc-numeric}
mmc <- as.numeric (sf::st_centroid (mmc [[1]]))
```

## Distance chloropleth

Extracting the surrounding street network can then be done very simply with the
[`dodgr` package](https://github.com/ATFutures/dodgr). The `expand` argument is
a relative expansion, so the value of `expand = 1` will **double** the size of
the bounding box. (And there is currently no way to do this in absolute terms,
although that would be a nifty enhancement.)
```{r dodgr-streetnet}
library (dodgr)
dat <- dodgr_streetnet ("Clayton Victoria", expand = 1)
```
We're only interested in routing automobiles here, so reduce the street network
to only appropriate types, to speed up calculations below.
This requires loading `sf` for the sub-setting to work properly.
```{r, road-subset, message = FALSE}
table (dat$highway)
library (sf)
dat <- dat [which (!dat$highway %in%
                   c ("footway", "cycleway", "path", "pedestrian", "steps")), ]
```


Then extract distances between the MMC centroid and all points of the
surrounding network. The `dodgr_contract_graph()` function contracts the street
network to junction nodes only, which makes these kinds of calculations much
faster.
```{r dodgr-dists, message = FALSE}
graph <- weight_streetnet (dat, wt_profile = "motorcar")
nrow (graph)
graph <- dodgr_contract_graph (graph)$graph
nrow (graph)
verts <- dodgr_vertices (graph)
d <- dodgr_dists (graph = graph, from = mmc, to = verts)
```

These distances then need to be mapped back on to the street network to generate
the chloropleth. They all come with OSM identifiers (here, the `colnames`).
```{r dists-to-graph}
indx <- cbind (match (graph$from_id, colnames (d)),
			   match (graph$to_id, colnames (d)))
# The "min" function below is arbitrary, but just takes one value
indx <- apply (indx, 1, function (i) min (i, na.rm = TRUE))
graph$dmmc <- d [indx]
```

## Visualistion

Visualising first requires conversion back to `sf` format:
```{r sf, message = FALSE}
graph_sfc <- dodgr_to_sfc (graph)
library (sf)
graph_sf <- st_sf (graph_sfc$dat, graph_sfc$geoms)
# not all nodes will necessarily be reachable on the network, so remove
# unreachable ones
graph_sf <- graph_sf [which (!is.na (graph_sf$dmmc)), ]
```

Then use `mapview` for a simple interactive visualisation (with screenshot
below).

```{r mapview, eval = FALSE}
library (mapview)
ncols <- 30
d <- graph_sf$dmmc / max (graph_sf$dmmc)
cols <- colorRampPalette (c ("lawngreen", "red")) (ncols) [ceiling (ncols * d)]
mapview (graph_sf, color = cols, lwd = 5 * (1 - d))
```
